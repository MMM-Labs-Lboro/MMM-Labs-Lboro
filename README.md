We are the Multifunctional Materials Manufacturing Research Lab, Loughborough University (@MMM-Labs-Lboro). Our team of talented researchers work to develop novel products, structures and materials that can be used to serve multiple functions.

Our team often uses this large community to aid in out reseach - analysing big data sets with large scale codes and protocols. We have chosen to share some of what we have made, in the hopes that what we have made may be useful to others and to give back to the community.

For latest news on the labs latest developments, see our blog; https://carmentorressanchez.wordpress.com/.
